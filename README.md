# About Rossmann
Rossmann is a prominent chain of drug stores operating across seven European countries, with over 3,000 stores in its network. The company offers a wide range of products, including pharmaceuticals, personal care items, beauty products, household goods, and more. Rossmann is known for its extensive product selection, competitive pricing, and convenient store locations. Founded in Germany in 1972 by Dirk Rossmann, the company has since expanded its presence across Europe, becoming one of the largest drug store chains in the region. Rossmann's stores are known for their modern and inviting layouts, making shopping convenient and enjoyable for customers.

## Problem Statement
Rossmann operates a large chain of drug stores across seven European countries, totaling over 3,000 stores. Store managers are responsible for predicting daily sales up to six weeks in advance, considering various influencing factors such as promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and locality. However, the accuracy of sales predictions varies among individual managers due to their unique circumstances and approaches. 

To address this variability and improve forecasting accuracy, the task is to develop a robust machine learning model using historical sales data from 1,115 Rossmann stores. The objective is to accurately forecast the "Sales" column for the test set, considering factors like promotions, holidays, and other relevant features. This model will provide store managers with reliable sales forecasts, enabling them to optimize inventory management, staffing, and promotional strategies, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and maximizing revenue across Rossmann stores.

## Project Summary
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed insights such as:
- The linear relationship between customers and sales.
- The impact of promotions and holidays on sales.
- Seasonal sales patterns.

Data preprocessing involved:
- Converting date columns.
- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical features.
- Removing outliers.

Feature engineering included creating new features and removing multicollinear features to improve model performance.

## Machine Learning Model Implementation
### 1. Model Selection
- **Decision Trees**: Used for its simplicity and interpretability.
- **Random Forests**: An ensemble method that improves accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.
- **XGBoost**: A powerful boosting algorithm that optimizes performance through parallel processing.
- **CatBoost**: Effective for categorical features, enhancing prediction without extensive preprocessing.

### 2. Model Evaluation
- **Performance Evaluation Metrics**: Utilized metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² Score, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate performance.
- **Cross-Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning**: Document the effects of hyperparameter tuning on model performance. Present updated evaluation metrics before and after tuning to illustrate improvements.

### 3. Insights on Evaluation Metrics



Hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize model performance. Random Forest Regression was selected as the final prediction model due to its superior performance after tuning and its ability to handle non-linearity and feature importance evaluation. Model explainability was achieved through feature importance analysis using Random Forest.

The final model achieved significant improvements in predictive accuracy, making it a valuable tool for Rossmann store managers to forecast sales and optimize business strategies.
